[maxMachalek3050FinalReport](https://github.com/MaxMachalek/PriorStatsWork/blob/main/maxMachalek3050FinalReport.pdf) is an analysis of a fictional war scenario with a fictional country, led by the nefarious Dr. Doom, using **multiple linear regression**. The task was to present the effects of a number of different variables with respect to how they might affect enemy casualties versus civilian casualties in a potential war scenario. The data used was generated by the professor to make creation of an *exceedingly* good model challenging, but possible.

[Principal_Component_Analysis](https://github.com/MaxMachalek/PriorStatsWork/blob/main/DataMining_PCA/Principal_Component_Analysis.pdf) is an assignment from my Data Mining class in which **Principal Component Analysis** and **Cluster Analysis** were used to classify flowers.
