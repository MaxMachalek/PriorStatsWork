A collection of a few previous statistics projects and assignments.
=====

## Statistical Methods
Focused on applications of simple and multiple linear regression in R #

[maxMachalek3050FinalReport](https://github.com/MaxMachalek/PriorStatsWork/blob/main/maxMachalek3050FinalReport.pdf) is an analysis of a fictional war scenario with a fictional country, led by the nefarious Dr. Doom, using **multiple linear regression**. The task was to present the effects of a number of different variables with respect to how they might affect enemy casualties versus civilian casualties in a potential war scenario. The data used was generated by the professor to make creation of an *exceedingly* good model challenging, but possible.

=====

## Data Mining
Covered both the mathematical basis and computational implementation in R of a wide range of data mining topics. Topics included: multiple linear regression in high dimensions, cross validation methods, logistic regression, K nearest neighbors, discriminant analysis, decision trees, bagging/random forests/boosting, support vector machines, principal component analysis, and cluster analysis.

[Principal_Component_Analysis](https://github.com/MaxMachalek/PriorStatsWork/blob/main/DataMining_PCA/Principal_Component_Analysis.pdf) is an assignment from my Data Mining class in which **Principal Component Analysis** and **Cluster Analysis** were used to classify flowers. 

-----

[Logistic_Regression_LDA_QDA_KNN](https://github.com/MaxMachalek/PriorStatsWork/blob/main/DataMining_LogisticReg_LDA_QDA_KNN/Logistic_Regression_LDA_QDA_KNN.pdf) is another assignment from my Data Mining class. **logistic regression**, **linear discriminant analysis**, **quadratic discriminant analysis**, and **K-nearest neighbors** are applied to data regarding survival rates on the RMS Titanic.

=====

## Multivariate Analysis 
Covered both the mathematical basis and computational implementation in R of a wide range of multivariate topics. Topics included: plotting multivariate data, multivariate regression, principal component analysis, canonical correlation analysis, cluster analysis, multidimensional scaling, multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), discriminant analysis, exploratory factor analysis, and confirmatory factor analysis.
